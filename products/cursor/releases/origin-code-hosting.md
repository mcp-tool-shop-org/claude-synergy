# cursor — Origin Code Hosting

<p>Cursor can now host your code.</p>
<p>Origin begins rolling out today in early beta on all paid plans. We&#39;re starting with the essentials, designed for agent scale: repos, pull requests, code browsing, and GitHub sync. Agent-native features ship soon.</p>
<h2>Origin Repos</h2>
<p>The new **Codebase** tab is home for Origin repos.</p>
<p>Click **+New** to create a new repo and name it. Once you do, a page shows you how to install the CLI, with commands for how to clone a repo or push a local project. Push, and your code is hosted on Origin.</p>
<p>For Origin-hosted repos, Origin is the source of truth. Pushes land on Origin, and GitHub is not in the path.</p>
<p>Name your codebase when you create your first repo. That name becomes part of every repo&#39;s URL: cursor.com/codebase/`acme-corp`.</p>
<h2>Bring your GitHub repos</h2>
<p>Your GitHub repos can sit alongside the ones Cursor hosts. Connect GitHub to Cursor, pick your org, and you&#39;ll see the repos you can sync. Select one and Cursor pulls it in. You choose what gets synced and can disconnect a repo at any time. Anyone with read or write access to a synced repo can view it in Cursor too.</p>
<p>Synced repos update in real time. Browse, search, and pull from the copy in Origin. For synced repos, GitHub stays the source of truth: pushes keep going to GitHub, and Origin mirrors the result. Icons next to each repo name tell you which ones Cursor hosts and which came from GitHub.</p>
<h2>Pull requests</h2>
<p>Every repo has pull requests. Open one to see the timeline, commits, checks, and files changed. Review the diff, leave comments, and merge.</p>
<p>Pull requests on synced repos sync both ways: comment in Cursor and it posts to GitHub, react or reply on GitHub and it shows up in Cursor within seconds. Got a review assigned to you on GitHub? Review and merge it from Cursor.</p>
<h2>Agents in every repo</h2>
<p>Your code, PRs, and agents are now in the same place. Ask Cursor questions about code you&#39;re browsing. It can answer, make changes, update PRs, or push a branch.</p>
<h2>App extensions for Cursor repos</h2>
<p>We&#39;re building an app ecosystem so your whole stack works seamlessly with Origin. Integrations with Vercel, Depot, and Buildkite are already available, with more coming soon.</p>
<p>Connect Vercel from a repo&#39;s **Apps** tab and every PR gets a preview deployment where you can test and make comments. Merge, and it ships to production. For CI, connect Depot or Buildkite. Both run your existing GitHub Actions workflows and Buildkite also runs its native pipelines.</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>Every repo has settings. Check sync status for GitHub repos, manage who has access, and see which apps are connected.</p>
